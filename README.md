Thore are my own custom C Header files that have helped me quite alot.

misc.h:
Here are defined the logical  and comparison operators using Natural Language
So instead of (&&) you can write (AND). It also has a few functions reffering
void pointers and array operations using them.

array.h:
Here is defined the "Array" structure which is more well known as "List" or "ArrayList".
It has functions to dynamically add, remove, replace objects.
It supports searching and sorting and keeps trak of the length at all times.
